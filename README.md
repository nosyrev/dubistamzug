## How to use
You will need to have [python3 interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
Probably you alredy have it, try to run `python --version` in your Terminal. If it works - all good :)

After that just install `jupyter-lab` and `pandas` if you don't also already have it.

`pip install jupyterlab pandas`

Then just run `jupyter-lab` in your terminal, that will open a tab with lab inyour brouser. Open `dubistamzug.ipynb` there and press "Run All".
All code within the cells would be executed after that
